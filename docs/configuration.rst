Configuration
=============

In the last section, we gathered our API credentials for the Stormpath API.
Now we'll configure our Express application to use them.

Now that we've got all the prerequisites out of the way, let's take a look at
some code!  Integrating Express-Stormpath into an application can take as little
as **1 minute**!


Environment Variables
---------------------
Most Node.js applications expect your confidential information to be
exposed by the environment (not hard-coded in the application).  You
should export your Stormpath information by running this in the shell:

 .. code-block:: bash

    export STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_ID=YOUR-ID-HERE
    export STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_SECRET=YOUR-SECRET-HERE
    export STORMPATH_APPLICATION_HREF=YOUR-APP-HREF

.. note::
    If you're on Windows, that will look like::

        set STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_ID=YOUR-ID-HERE


Initialize Express-Stormpath
----------------------------

To initialize Express-Stormpath, you need to use the ``stormpath.init``
middleware and provide a configuration object.

Below is a minimal Express application which shows how you can import and
initialize the Stormpath middleware:

 .. code-block:: javascript

    var express = require('express');
    var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');

    var app = express();
    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      // Optional configuration options.
      website: true
    }));

    // Once Stormpath has initialized itself, start your web server!
    app.on('stormpath.ready', function () {
      app.listen(3000);
    });

The Stormpath middleware is what initializes Stormpath, grabs configuration
information, and manages sessions / user state.  It is the base of all
Express-Stormpath functionality.

.. note::
    The Stormpath middleware **must** always be the last initialized middleware,
    but must come **before** any custom route code.  If not, you may experience
    odd side effects.

Lastly, as of version **0.5.9** of this library -- if you're using Heroku you
don't need to specify your credentials or application at all -- these values
will be automatically populated for you.


Option Profiles
---------------

Web server or API server? Both?  You can opt into one or both, and we'll
automatically  attach the required middleware to your application.  The options
are:

 .. code-block:: javascript

    {
      "website": true,  // serves HTML login pages
      "api": true       // enabled OAuth client credentials and token authentication
    }

Full documentation of the options will be coming soon.  In the meantime, please
refer to this JSON config which shows you the default options:

https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-framework-spec/blob/master/web-config.yaml


Stormpath Client Options
------------------------

When you initialize this library, it creates an instance of a Stormpath Client.
This comes from the `Stormpath Node SDK`_.  The client options allow you to
control options such as which caching engine to use (in-memory, by default).  For
a full reference of options, please see this link:

https://docs.stormpath.com/nodejs/api/client

If you would like to work directly with the client in your Express application,
you can fetch it from the app object like this::

    app.get('/secret', function (req, res) {
      var client = req.app.get('stormpathClient');

      // For example purposes only -- you probably don't want to actually expose
      // this information to your users =)
      client.getCurrentTenant(function (err, tenant) {
        if (err) {
          return res.status(400).json(err);
        }

        res.json(tenant);
      });
    });


Startup
-------

If you followed the step above, you will now have fully functional
registration, login, and logout functionality active on your site!  Your site
should be live on this URL:

http://localhost:3000

Don't believe me?  Test it out!  Start up your Express web server now, and I'll
walk you through the basics:

- Navigate to ``/register``.  You will see a registration page.  Go ahead and
  enter some information.  You should be able to create a user account.  Once
  you've created a user account, you'll be automatically logged in, then
  redirected back to the root URL (``/``, by default).
- Navigate to ``/logout``.  You will now be logged out of your account, then
  redirected back to the root URL (``/``, by default).
- Navigate to ``/login``.  You will see a login page.  You can now re-enter
  your user credentials and log into the site again.

Wasn't that easy?!

.. note::
    You probably noticed that you couldn't register a user account without
    specifying a sufficiently strong password.  This is because, by default,
    Stormpath enforces certain password strength rules on your Stormpath
    Directories.

    If you'd like to change these password strength rules (*or disable them*),
    you can do so easily by visiting the `Stormpath dashboard`_, navigating to
    your user Directory, then changing the "Password Strength Policy".


Single Page Applications
------------------------

This framework is designed to work with front-end frameworks like
Angular and React.  This framework provides a JSON API for all of the
features, you will use this JSON API from your front end application.
Each feature section in this guide has specific information for the
JSON API, please see those sections for feature documenation.

In some cases you may need to specify the ``spaRoot`` option.  This
is the absolute file path to the entry point for your SPA.  That option
would be defined like this::

    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      web: {
        spaRoot: path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html')
      }
    }));

This allows our famework to serve your SPA, for routes that
this framework also wants to handle. You need this option if
the following are true:

 * Your SPA is using HTML5 history mode
 * You want the default feature routes, such as ``/login`` to
   serve your Angular Application
 * You don't want to use our default login and registration views
