.. _authentication:

Authentication
==============

This library offers several options for securing your application and
authenticating your users.  Which strategy should you use?  The answer depends
on your use case, and we'll discuss each one in detail.  But at a high level,
your choices look like this:

  * If you are building a traditional web app or single page application, you
    should use **Cookie Authentication**.

  * If you are building a mobile application, you should use the **OAuth2
    Password Grant**.

  * If you are building an API service, you can use
    **HTTP Basic Authentication** or **OAuth2 Client Credentials**.



Cookie Authentication
---------------------

If you are building a web application that serves traditional HTML pages, or a
Single Page Application (Angular/React), this library will handle the cookie
sessions for you.  No special configuration is necessary.

To use cookie authentication, simply use the ``loginRequired`` middleware::

    app.get('/secret', stormpath.loginRequired, function (req, res) {
      /*
        If we get here, the user is logged in.  Otherwise, they
        were redirected to the login page
       */
      res.send('Hello, ' + req.user.fullname);
    });

.. tip::
    See :ref:`getUser` to learn how to use the getUser
    middleware to access the current user account.

Behind the scenes we are issuing a OAuth2 Access Token and Refresh Token for
the user, and storing them in secure, HTTPS-Only cookies.  After the user has
logged in, these cookies will be supplied on every request.  Our library will
assert that the Access Token is valid.  If the Access Token is expired, we will
attempt to refresh it with the Refresh Token.


.. note::
    Express-Stormpath's OAuth2 cookie feature will not interfere with any
    existing cookie-based session middleware you might have.  The cookies that
    Stormpath creates are used exclusively for Stormpath's purposes, so it's
    safe to create your own separate sessions if needed.

.. _setting_token_expiration_time:

Setting Token Expiration Time
.............................

If you need to change the expiration time of the Access Token or Refresh Token,
please login to the Stormpath Admin Console and navigate to the OAuth policy of
your Stormpath Application.  There you will find the settings for each token.

.. _configuring_cookie_flags:

Configuring Cookie Flags
........................

This library creates two cookies, one for the Access Token and one for the
Refresh Token.  There are several options available for controlling the flags
that are set on these cookies.

Here is an example configuration block, with the default settings:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
    web: {
      accessTokenCookie: {
        domain: null,
        httpOnly: true,
        path: "/",
        secure: null
      },
      refreshTokenCookie: {
        // same as the accessTokenCookie
      }
    }
  }

This table describes each setting in detail:

+-------------+---------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Cookie Flag | Default | Description                                          |
+=============+=========+======================================================+
| domain      | null    | Set if needed, e.g. "subdomain.mydomain.com".        |
+-------------+---------+------------------------------------------------------+
| httpOnly    | true    | True by default, do not disable without good reason  |
|             |         | (exposes tokens to XSS | attacks).                   |
+-------------+---------+------------------------------------------------------+
| path        | "/"     | Set if needed, e.g. "/newapp".                       |
+-------------+---------+------------------------------------------------------+
| secure      | null    | Will be ``true`` in HTTPS environments (as detected  |
|             |         | by ``req.protocol``), unless explicitly set to       |
|             |         | ``false`` (not recommended!).                        |
+-------------+---------+------------------------------------------------------+

.. _token_validation_strategy:

Token Validation Strategy
.........................

When a request comes into your server, this library will use the Access Token
and Refresh Token cookies to make an authentication decision.  The default
validation strategy (``local``) works like this:

- If the Access Token signature is valid, and the token is not expired, accept
  the request.

- If the Access Token is expired, attempt to get a new one from the Stormpath
  REST API by using the Refresh Token.

- If a new Access Token cannot be obtained, deny the request.

With the ``local`` option, our library only checks the signature and expiration of
the Access Token.  It does not check with the Stormpath REST API to assert that
the Access Token hasn't been revoked.

If you would like to check for Access Token revocation on every request, you
should opt-in to the ``stormpath`` validation strategy.  This will make a
network call to the Stormpath REST API.  If the Access Token has been revoked,
or the account has been disabled or deleted, the request will be rejected.

Opt-in to ``stormpath`` validation with this configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
    web: {
      oauth2: {
        password: {
          validationStrategy: 'stormpath'
        }
      }
    }
  }

.. warning::

  When using local validation, your server will not be aware of token revocation
  or any changes to the associated Stormpath account.  **This is a security
  trade-off that optimizes for performance.**  If you prefer extra security, use
  the ``stormpath`` validation option.

  If you prefer local validation, for the performance reasons, you can add more
  security by doing one of the following:

  * Use a short expiration time for your Access Tokens (such as five minutes or
    less).  This will limit the amount of time that the Access Token can be used
    for validation, while still reducing the number of times that we need to
    make a REST API call, with the refresh token, to get a new access token.

  * Maintain a blacklist of revoked Access Tokens, in your local application
    cache. Implement a middleware function that asserts that the Access Token is
    not in this cache, and reject the request if true.  We may implement this as
    a convenience feature in the future.


Issuing API Keys
----------------

If you are building an API service, you will need to distribute API keys to your
developers.  They will then use these keys to authenticate with your API, either
via HTTP Basic Auth or OAuth2 Access tokens.  We'll cover those strategies in
the next sections, but we need to provision API keys for your developers first.

While your service may be an API service, you will still need to provide a
basic website that developers can use to obtain their keys.  Here is an example
of how you can create an API Key for the currently logged in user::

    app.post('/apiKeys', stormpath.loginRequired, function (req, res) {
      req.user.createApiKey(function (err, apiKey) {
        if (err) {
          res.status(400).end('Oops!  There was an error: ' + err.userMessage);
        }else{
          res.json(apiKey);
        }
      });
    });

.. tip::
    See :ref:`getUser` to learn how to use the getUser
    middleware to access the current user account.

This is a naive example which simply prints out the API Keys for the user, but
once they have the keys they will be able to authenticate with your API.

For more information on API Keys, please see
`Using Stormpath for API Authentication`_

HTTP Basic Authentication
-------------------------

This strategy makes sense if you are building a simple API service that does
not have complex needs around authorization and resource control.  This strategy
is simple because the developer simply supplies their API keys on every request
to your server.

Once the developer has their API keys, they will use them to authenticate with your
API.  For each request they will set the ``Authorization`` header, like this::

    Authorization: Basic <Base64UrlSafe(apiKeyId:apiKeySecret)>

How this is done will depend on what tool or library they are using.  For example,
if using curl:

.. code-block:: sh

  curl -v --user apiKeyId:apiKeySecret http://localhost:3000/secret

Or if you're using the ``request`` library:

.. code-block:: javascript

  var request = require('request');

  request({
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/secret',
    auth: {
      user: 'apiKeyId',
      pass: 'apiKeySecret'
    }
  }, function (err, res){
    console.log(res.body);
  });

You will need to tell your application that you want to secure this endpoint and
allow basic authentication.  This is done with the ``apiAuthenticationRequired``
middleware::

    app.get('/secret', stormpath.apiAuthenticationRequired, function (req, res) {
      res.json({
        message: "Hello, " + req.user.fullname
      });
    });

.. tip::
    See :ref:`getUser` to learn how to use the getUser
    middleware to access the current user account.


OAuth2 Client Credentials
-------------------------

If you are building an API service and you have complex needs around
authorization and security, this strategy should be used.  In this situation
the developer does a one-time exchange of their API Keys for an Access Token.
This Access Token is time limited and must be periodically refreshed.  This adds a
layer of security, at the cost of being less simple than HTTP Basic
Authentication.

If you're not sure which strategy to use, it's best to start with HTTP Basic
Authentication. You can always switch to OAuth2 at a later time.

Once a developer has an API Key pair (see above, *Issuing API Keys*), they will
need to use the OAuth2 Token Endpoint to obtain an Access Token.  In simple
HTTP terms, that request looks like this::


    POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: myapi.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Authorization: Basic <Base64UrlSafe(apiKeyId:apiKeySecret)>

    grant_type=client_credentials

How you construct this request will depend on your library or tool, but the key
parts you need to know are:

  * The request must be a POST request.
  * The content type must be form encoded, and the body must contain
    ``grant_type=client_credentials``.
  * The Authorization header must be Basic and contain the Base64 Url-Encoded
    values of the Api Key Pair.

If you were doing this request with curl, it would look like this:

.. code-block:: sh

  curl -X POST --user api_key_id:api_key_secret http://localhost:3000/oauth/token -d grant_type=client_credentials

Or if using the ``request`` library:

.. code-block:: javascript

  request({
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/oauth/token',
    method: 'POST',
    auth: {
      user: '1BWQHHJCOW90HI7HFQ5LTD6O0',
      pass: 'zzeu+NwmicjtJ9yDJ2KlRguC+8uTjKVm3AMs80ah6hw'
    },
    form: {
      'grant_type': 'client_credentials'
    }
  },function (err,res) {
    console.log(res.body);
  });

If the credentials are valid, you will get an Access Token response that looks
like this::

    {
      "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiL...",
      "token_type": "bearer",
      "expires_in": 3600
    }

The response is a JSON object which contains:

- ``access_token`` - Your OAuth Access Token.  This can be used to authenticate
  on future requests.
- ``token_type`` - This will always be ``"bearer"``.
- ``expires_in`` - This is the amount of seconds (*as an integer*) for which
  this token is valid.

With this token you can now make requests to your API.  This request is simpler,
as only thing you need to supply is ``Authorization`` header with the Access
Token as a bearer token.  If you are using curl, that request looks like this:

.. code-block:: sh

  curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiL..." http://localhost:3000/secret

Or if using the ``request`` library:

.. code-block:: javascript

  request({
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/secret',
    auth: {
      'bearer': 'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiL...'
    }
  }, function (err, res){
    console.log(res.body);
  });

In order to protect your API endpoint and allow this form of authenetication,
you need to use the ``apiAuthenticationRequired`` middleware::

    app.get('/secret', stormpath.apiAuthenticationRequired, function (req, res) {
      res.json({
        message: "Hello, " + req.user.fullname
      });
    });

.. tip::
    See :ref:`getUser` to learn how to use the getUser
    middleware to access the current user account.

By default the Access Tokens are valid for one hour.  If you want to change
the expiration of these tokens you will need to configure it in the server
configuration, like this::


    app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
      web: {
        oauth2: {
          client_credentials: {
            accessToken: {
              ttl: 3600 // your custom TTL, in seconds, goes here
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }));


OAuth2 Password Grant
---------------------

This is the authentication strategy that you will want to use for mobile clients.
In this situation the end-user supplies their username and password to your
mobile application.  The mobile application sends that username and password to
your Express application, which then verifies the password with Stormpath.

If the account is valid and the password is correct, Stormpath will generate
an Access Token for the user.  Your server gets this Access Token from Stormpath
and then sends it back to your mobile application.

The mobile application then stores the Access Token in a secure location, and
uses it for future requests to your API.  Every time the mobile application uses
this Access Token your server will verify that it's still valid, using Stormpath.

When a user wants to login to your mobile application, the mobile application
should make this request to your Express application::

    POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: myapi.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type=password
    &username=user@gmail.com
    &password=theirPassword

If the authentication is successful, the Stormpath API will return an Access
Token to your mobile application.  The response will look like this::

    {
      "refresh_token": "eyJraWQiOiI2...",
      "stormpath_access_token_href": "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accessTokens/3bBAHmSuTJ64DM574awVen",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiI2Nl...",
      "expires_in": 3600

Your mobile application should store the Access Token and Refresh Token.  By
default the Access Token is valid for 1 hour and the Refresh Token for 60 days.
When the Access Token expires you can get a new Access Token by using the
Refresh Token, making this request to your Express application::

    POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: myapi.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    grant_type=refresh_token
    &refresh_token=eyJraWQiOiI2...

The response will contain a new Access Token.  Once the Refresh Token expires,
the user will have to re-authenticate with a username and password.

You can control the lifetime of the Access Token and Refresh Token by modifying
the OAuth Policy of your Stormpath Application.  This can be found by logging
into the Stormpath Admin Console and finding your Application.
