**Major Release 3.0.0**

This is a complete list of changes you need to make to your 2.x application when
upgrading to 3.0.0.  For a high level overview of the major points in this
release, please see the :ref:`changelog`.

- We've stopped resolving the authenticated user by default.  You need to
  explicitly configure this with the ``stormpath.getUser`` middleware:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    app.get('/home', stormpath.getUser, function (req, res) {
      if (req.user) {
        res.send('Hello, ' + req.user.email);
      } else {
        res.send('Not logged in');
      }
    });

- The ``website`` and ``api`` configuration options have been removed, you can
  remove these from your configuration.  To enable or disable specific features,
  please review the `Web Configuration Defaults`_.

- The logout route is now a POST route, it will not respond to GET requests.
  You will need to use a form post or an AJAX request to logout the user.  This
  is a user experience fix, because the browser's omnibar was logging the user
  out when it tried to pre-fetch the logout route.

- The :ref:`token_validation_strategy` is now using the ``local`` option by
  default.  If you want to continue using the ``stormpath`` strategy, set
  ``web.oauth2.password.validationStrategy`` to ``stormpath``.

- You no longer need to wait for ``stormpath.ready`` to start your server.  If
  the server is waiting on Stormpath to initialize, it will hold the request
  until Stormpath is ready.

- The registration field configuration has changed.  You need to move your
  field definition and field order to be inside the new ``form`` property, like
  so:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    {
      web: {
        register: {
          form: {
            fields: {
              // field definitions are now here, under form.fields
            },
            fieldOrder: [
              // this has been moved as well
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }


- The impact of the expansion options have changed.  They can still be used to
  pre-populate ``req.user`` with the desired expanded properties, but they no
  longer expand those properties on our JSON responses from login and
  registration.  This is a security change.

- If you want the ``/me`` route to expand properties on the user object, you will
  need to explicitly enable those options for that feature, like so:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    {
      web: {
        me: {
          expand: {
            customData: true
          }
        }
      }
    }

- The JSON account data that is returned by login attempts, registration, and the
  ``/me`` route is now wrapped inside of an ``account`` property:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    {
      account: {
        href: 'xxx',
        // other properties
      }
    }

- Error messages from the JSON API have changed, previously the messages looked
  like ``{ error: 'error message' }`` but now they look like this:

  .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        status: 400,
        message: 'error message here'
      }

- The ``web.spaRoot`` root option has been changed, if you are telling us where
  your SPA root is located, you need to use this new configuration:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    {
      web: {
        spa: {
          enabled: true,
          view: 'path/to/spa-index.html'
        }
      }
    }

- The ``/spa-config`` route is removed, you need to fetch this view model
  information from the logout and registration endpoints.  Please see :ref:`json_login_api` and
  :ref:`json_registration_api`.

- For Google login, we now ask for ``"email profile"`` scope instead of just
  email, as this has more success with gathering the user's first name and last
  name from Google.

- The ``web.socialProviders`` configuration has been removed, the social login
  configuration now looks like this:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    {
      web: {
        social: {
          google: {
            scope: "email profile",
            uri: "/callbacks/google"
          },
          // facebook, linkedin, github
        }
      }
    }

- The default path for our access token and refresh token cookies was set to
  ``/``, but now it is undefined unless set by configuration.  Please see the
  `Web Configuration Defaults`_ for all the cookie options.


Version 2.3.7 -> Version 2.4.0
------------------------------

**Attention: Minor release that affects ID Site and Social Users**

If a user has previously authenticated with a social provider or ID Site, and
that user is currently logged in to your application, they will be logged out
and will need to log-in again.


Version 2.3.6 -> Version 2.3.7
------------------------------

If you were relying on this library to attach the `body-parser` middleware to
all routes in your application, you need to change your application and
configure the `body-parser` middleware outside of your application.  As of this
release, this library will only parse request bodies for requests that it is
going to handle.

Version 2.3.5 -> Version 2.3.6
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**

Version 2.3.4 -> Version 2.3.5
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**

Version 2.3.3 -> Version 2.3.4
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**

Version 2.3.2 -> Version 2.3.3
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**

Version 2.3.1 -> Version 2.3.2
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**

Version 2.3.0 -> Version 2.3.1
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**

Version 2.2.0 -> Version 2.3.0
--------------------------------

**Registration changes may be needed**

If you are supplying extra fields on registration (fields that are added to the
user's custom data object), and you are using an HTML-based form submission, you
now need to declare these fields in the registration configuration.

This change is necessary because we fixed this library to *not* allow arbitrary
submission of data to the account's custom data object.

Please see the registration section of this documentation for examples of how to
declare your custom fields.

The default value for first name and last name is now "UNKNOWN", if not provided
and not required during registration.  Previously it was "Anonymous".  If you
are depending on this value you will need to change your test to look for
"UNKONWN".

Version 2.1.0 -> Version 2.2.0
--------------------------------

**Changes may be needed**

The Oauth2 endpoint is now enabled by default.  You no longer need to use this
configuration option is you want to enable the OAuth2 endpoint:

.. code-block:: javascript

    stormpath.init(app, {
      api: true
    });

If you wish to *disable* the Oauth2 endpoint you can do so like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

    stormpath.init(app, {
      web: {
        oauth2: {
          enabled: false
        }
      }
    });


Version 2.0.14 -> Version 2.1.0
--------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 2.0.13 -> Version 2.0.14
--------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 2.0.12 -> Version 2.0.13
--------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 2.0.9 -> Version 2.0.10
-------------------------------

We were looking for the option ``config.web.register.autoAuthorize``, to
enable the auto-login-after-registration feature.   This should actually be
``autoLogin``, and it is documented as this. The library is now looking for
this option as ``autoLogin``, so you will need to change your configuration it
if you were using ``autoAuthorize``.


Version 2.0.8 -> Version 2.0.9
------------------------------

If you are using the ``/forgot`` endpoint and posting JSON, you need to change
the ``username`` property to ``email``.


Version 2.0.7 -> Version 2.0.8
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 2.0.6 -> Version 2.0.7
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 2.0.5 -> Version 2.0.6
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 2.0.4 -> Version 2.0.5
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 2.0.3 -> Version 2.0.4
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 2.0.2 -> Version 2.0.3
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 2.0.1 -> Version 2.0.2
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 2.0.0 -> Version 2.0.1
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 1.0.6 -> Version 2.0.0
------------------------------

**Many changes needed!**

This is a **major release** in the life of this library.  This release includes
tons of new features, refactoring, etc.

To upgrade from **1.0.6**, please pay careful attention to the below notes.

Firstly, this library now takes new configuration options.  When you initialize
the middleware, you'll need to pass in the following basic options:

.. code-block:: javascript

    stormpath.init(app, {
      client: {
        apiKey: {
          id: 'xxx',
          secret: 'yyy'
        }
      },
      application: {
        href: 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/xxx'
      }
    });

Every setting in the new configuration can also be set via environment
variables.  The way it works is that all nested fields are expanded out to their
full path.  For instance, if you wanted to set `client.apiKey.id`, you could
create an environment variable called::

    STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_ID=xxx

Likewise, for the rest of the settings above::

    STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_SECRET=yyy
    STORMPATH_APPLICATION_HREF=https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/xxx

Next, we've disabled default login, registration, and logout routes.  To enable
them, you'll want to do the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

    stormpath.init(app, {
      website: true
    });

This will enable the default *website* features this library provides:

- A login page (`/login`).
- A registration page (`/register`).
- A logout route (`/logout`).

We'll now also automatically enable certain features (*like password reset and
account verification emails*) based on your Stormpath Directory settings.  So,
if you've already configured your Stormpath Directory to enable the Account
Verification Workflow, no additional settings are required to make this work --
it'll just magically turn itself on =)

Furthermore, automatic expansion has changed.

Previously, you'd be able to enable Custom Data expansion, for instance, by
saying something like:

.. code-block:: javascript

    stormpath.init(app, {
      expandCustomData: true
    });

You'll now list expansion options inside of an ``expansion`` option, like so:

.. code-block:: javascript

    stormpath.init(app, {
      expand: {
        customData: true
      }
    });

The above also applies to all other expansion options.

Session management has also changed.  We now issue OAuth access tokens and
refresh tokens when a user logs in with a username and password.  These are
stored in the browser in HTTP-only, secure cookies.

This means that we no longer use a session middleware, as these token are
managed by the  Stormpath API.  Thus, the following has changed:

- The property ``req.stormpathSession`` has been removed, if you were using this
  property to store stateful session information you will need to add a session
  middleware to your library, such as `express-session`_.
- The ``secretKey`` option has been deprecated, and no longer needs to be
  supplied.
- The ``sessionDuration`` option has been removed.  The timeout settings for
  cookies are now tied to the TTL settings of the Access Tokens and Refresh
  Tokens.  These can be modified on the OAuth Policy of your Stormpath
  Application, please see :ref:`setting_token_expiration_time` for details.
- The ``sessionDomain`` option is deprecated, see
  :ref:`configuring_cookie_flags` for the new option format.

Next, we've disabled the `/oauth` endpoint we previously enabled by default.  If
you want to enable this, with its default settings, you can now do the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

    stormpath.init(app, {
      api: true
    });

Another important thing to note, our old OAuth functionality created a route
that lived at `/oauth`.  When you enable the *new* OAuth endpoint, it will live
at `/oauth/token` instead.  This was done to comply with the OAuth2 spec more
closely, and ensure compatibility between libraries / frameworks.

We've also changed the password reset flow route from `/forgot/change` to  `/change`.
And for social login the callback route that were previously  `/[provider id]` is
now `/callbacks/[provider id]. I.e. `/google` has turned into `/callbacks/google`.

And for email verification the path has changed from `/verified` to `/verify`.

Other than the above, your upgrade process should go smoothly.  There are, of
course, lots of new features / configuration options, so please read through the
new library documentation to get a feeling for it!

Thanks for reading,

-Randall


Version 1.0.5 -> Version 1.0.6
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 1.0.4 -> Version 1.0.5
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 1.0.3 -> Version 1.0.4
------------------------------

If you were previously working with Stormpath sessions directly, then you'll
need to modify your code.  While previously Stormpath sessions were referred to
by ``req.session``, they are now referred to by ``req.stormpathSession``.

Version 1.0.1 -> Version 1.0.2
------------------------------

**No changes needed!**


Version 1.0.0 -> Version 1.0.1
------------------------------

Version 0.6.9 -> Version 1.0.0
------------------------------

This is a major release that breaks several things from older releases.

Firstly, if you were previously using the ``postRegistrationHandler`` to perform
custom logic after a new user registers, you'll need to modify this event
handler to accept new arguments.

Previously, the ``postRegistrationHandler`` had a method signature that looked
like this::

    postRegistrationHandler(account, res, next) { ... }

In this release, we're modifying the method signature to look like this::

    postRegistrationHandler(account, req, res, next) { ... }

What we've done is add in a new parameter: ``req``, which is the Express request
object.  This gives you more control over the request, and allows you to do
things like modify session data, etc.

Secondly, we no longer support old sessions.

If you are upgrading directly from an older release (*version 0.2.x*) to this
release, then your existing user sessions will be invalid, and this will force
your users to re-authenticate the next time they visit your site.  This is due
to a change in the way we store session data that was introduced in *version
0.3.x*.

.. note::
    The session change will NOT break your code, but it WILL require your users
    to re-authenticate the next time they visit your site.

If you were previously relying on the built-in CSRF validation in your pages,
you'll need to include CSRF manually.  This release no longer includes CSRF
token protection on *all* pages -- it only protects the Stormpath pages --
this was done to be less confusing for users.

To add CSRF protection to your site similar to what was included automatically
before, you'll want to use the express-csurf library, which you can find on
Github here: https://github.com/expressjs/csurf
