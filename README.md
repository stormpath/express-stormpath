Express-Stormpath is an extension for [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) that makes it incredibly simple to add user authentication to your application, such as login, signup, authorization, and social login.

*[Stormpath](https://stormpath.com/) is a User Management API that reduces development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Stormpath's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage and secure users and roles in any application.*

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to add Stormpath user authentication to your Express.js app.

1. **Download Your Key File**

  Downlaod your API Key file by logging in to [https://api.stormpath.com/login](api.stormpath.com/login) and clicking the “Create API Key” button under the “Developer Tools” section.

2. **Store Your Key As Environment Variables**

  Open your key file and grab the **API Key ID** and **API Key Secret**, then run these commands to save them as environment variables:

  ```bash
  $ export STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_ID=<YOUR-ID-HERE>
  $ export STORMPATH_CLIENT_APIKEY_SECRET=<YOUR-SECRET-HERE>
  ```

  *On Windows, use the `set` or `setx` command instead of `export`.*

3. **Get Your Stormpath App HREF**

  Login to the [Stormpath Console](https://api.stormpath.com/) and grab the *HREF* (called **REST URL** in the UI) of your *Application*. It should look something like this:

  `https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/q42unYAj6PDLxth9xKXdL`

4. **Store Your Stormpath App HREF In an Environment Variable**

  ```bash
  $ export STORMPATH_APPLICATION_HREF=<YOUR-STORMPATH-APP-HREF>
  ```

  *On Windows, use the `set` or `setx` command instead of `export`.*

5. **Install The SDK**

  ```bash
  $ npm install --save express-stormpath
  ```

6. **Include It In Your App**

  ```javascript
  var stormpath = require('express-stormpath');
  ```

7. **Initialize It**

  You need to initialize the middlware and use it with your application.  We have
  options for various use cases.

  **If your app is a traditional website:**

  Initialize the Stormpath module, and pass an empty set of options:

  ```javascript
  app.use(stormpath.init(app, { }));
  ```

  This will enable the default features, such as login and registration pages.

  **If your app is a single page application (Angular, React)**

  You will need to tell our library where the root file is.  For example, if
  your Angular app is in the `client/` folder in your project:

  ```javascript
  app.use(stormpath.init(app, {
    web: {
      spa: {
        enabled: true,
        view: path.join(__dirname, 'client', 'index.html')
      }
    }
  }));
  ```

  *[Read more about the initialization in the documentation →][]*

8. **Wait For The SDK**

  Wait for the SDK to get ready, then start the web server:

  ```javascript
  app.on('stormpath.ready', function () {
    app.listen(3000, function () {
      //...
    });
  });
  ```

9. **Protect Your Routes**

  For websites and Single-Page Apps, use `stormpath.authenticationRequired` as a
  middleware to protect your routes:

  ```javascript
  app.get('/secret', stormpath.authenticationRequired, function (req, res) {
    //...
  });
  ```

  For API services that use HTTP Basic Auth, use
  `stormpath.apiAuthenticationRequired`:

  ```javascript
  app.get('/secret', stormpath.apiAuthenticationRequired, function (req, res) {
    //...
  });
  ```

  If the user tries to access this route without being logged in, they will be redirected to the login page.

10. **Login**

  To access a protected route, the user must first login.

  **Traditional Websites:**

  You can login by visiting the `/login` URL and submitting the login form.

  **Single Page Apps:**

  Your front-end client should POST this data to the `/login` endpoint:

  ```javascript
  {
    "username": "foo@bar.com",
    "password": "myPassword"
  }
  ```

  *Note: make sure that your client is setting the `Accept: application/json`
  header on the request.*

  *Using AngularJS?  Try our [Stormpath Angular SDK][]*

  **API Services**

  If your app is an API service that uses our client_credentials workflow, your API consumers
  can obtain access tokens by making this POST to your server:

  ```
  POST /oauth/token
  Authorization: Basic <Base64Endoded(ACCOUNT_API_KEY_ID:ACCOUNT_API_KEY_SECRET)>;
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  grant_type=client_credentials
  ```

  *[Read more about login in the documentation →][]*

11. **Register**

  To be able to login, your users first need an account.

  **Traditional Websites:**

  Users can register by visiting the `/register` URL and submitting the
  registration form.

  **Single Page Applications:**

  Your front-end client should POST this data to the `/register` endpoint:

  ```javascript
  {
    "email": "foo@bar.com",
    "password": "mySuper3ecretPAssw0rd",
    "givenName": "baz",
    "surname": "qux"
  }
  ```

  If the user was created successfully, you will receive a 200 response and the
  body will contain the account that was created. If an error occurred, we will
  send a 400 status with an error message in the body.

  *Note: make sure that your client is setting the `Accept: application/json`
  header on the request.*

  *Using AngularJS?  Try our [Stormpath Angular SDK][]*

12. **That's It!**

  You just added user authentication to your app with Stormpath. See the [documentation][] for further information on how Stormpath can be used with your Express.js app.
